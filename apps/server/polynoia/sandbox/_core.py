# (e.g. ~/.bashrc). On hosts that keep them ONLY in ~/.claude/settings.json's
# ``env`` block (the recommended way for custom endpoints), the server process
# env does NOT have them — see _claude_settings_env() below, which is the
# canonical source.
#
# NOTE: deliberately NOT CLAUDE_CODE_* here. When the Polynoia server is itself
# launched from inside a Claude Code session (common in dev), its env carries
# CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID / _SSE_PORT / _CHILD_SESSION — parent-session identity
# that must NOT leak into sub-agents (the spawned CLI would think it's a child
# of THIS session). CLAUDE_CODE_* the user genuinely wants lives in the
