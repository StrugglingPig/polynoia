"""Adapter pool — DB-aware lookup of contact → adapter + session caching.

Now that contacts are user-created (multiple per adapter, each with its own
model + system_prompt), the pool resolves each agent_id by reading the AgentRow
from the DB on first session creation:

    setup.adapter_id ("claudeCode" / "codex" / "opencoder")  → base Adapter
    setup.model                                              → spawn --model
    agent.system_prompt                                      → spawn system

Built-in agents (orchestrator) still go through the same path — orchestrator's
``setup.adapter_id`` is set to "claudeCode" at seed time.

Sessions are still cached by (agent_id, conv_id). When a contact's model
changes (PATCH /api/contacts/{id}), the caller must invalidate cached sessions
via ``close_sessions_for_agent(agent_id)``.
